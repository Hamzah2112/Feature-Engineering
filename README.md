# Feature-Engineering
Performed different methods for feature engineering.
The methods are divided into 3 parts:

**Part 1**: Described all the types of missing values and different methods to caputure it for categorical as well as for numerical Data
The techniques used are:-
**a)- Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**
**b)-Random Sample Imputation**
**c)-Capturing NAN values with a new feature**
**d)-End of distribution imputation**
**e)-Arbitrary Value imputation**
 
 **Part 2**: Described all types of encoding techniques used to convert categorical data
 **(I)-Nominal Encoding**
  a)- One Hot Encoding
  b)- One hot encoding with many categories in a feature
  c)-Count Or Frequency Encoding:
  
  **(II)-Ordinal Encoding**
  a)-Ordinal Number Encoding
  b)- Target guided Ordinal Encoding
  c)-Mean Encoding
  d)- Probablity Ratio Encoding
  
  **Part 3**: Need and use of Transformation of Features
  **a)-Standardization**
  **b)-Normalization/Min-Max Transformation**
  **c)-Robust Scaling To Median And Quantiles**
